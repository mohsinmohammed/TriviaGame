### Trivia Game

## Project Description:

In Trivia Game, a player is shown questions that can be answered by clicking on the multiple choices. A count down clock appears with each question and player need to answer the question in a given time. When player clicks on an option, player's choice is evaluated and informed if correct or incorrect answer was chosen. And if the time runs out before the question is answered, the correct answer is displayed. A few seconds after displaying the correct answer, the next question is displayed without any player's input. When all questions of the game are displayed, the program will show the final results of the game. Player will know the number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.
